Update your own `README.md` using the template below. We are specifically interested in the installation instructions (e.g., all the necessary dependencies, how to load real or seed data, etc.). This sample README was originally developed for a Rails project, and the "Dependencies" section of the "Installation" instructions was originally called "Gems" to reflect that. Feel free to rename back for Rails projects. For all other types of projects, simply include libraries and add-ons that are relevant to you. (Note that with the use of Github Actions, a lot of the installation and continuous integration can be automated!)


**Make sure to check out the repo anew (potentially on a loaned laptop) and test your installation instructions.**



Provide a README file with the following information:

# Project Name

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

TODO: A 20-second elevator pitch of your project - its core idea summarized in one sentence.

### Additional information about the project

TODO: Write a compelling/creative/informative project description / summary, as part of which you... 
... TODO: Name the **target audience** (result of your initial user analysis)
... TODO: Name the **main functionality** you plan to achieve (result of your initial task analysis) 


## Installation

### Prerequisites

TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which version(s) of your framework(s) of choice)

### Dependencies

TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), you can run GitHub Actions locally). 


## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.


## Known Problems

TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. 
Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.


## Contributing

TODO: Leave the steps below if you want others outside your team to contribute to your project.

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## License

If you haven't already, add a file called `LICENSE.txt` with the text of the appropriate license.

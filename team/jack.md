# Jack Kilgore - Ideas for fmSynthesizer

* I would like to eventually get this working as plugin. Firstly for the open-source, virtual modular program, VCV Rack. If possible I would like to get it working as a VST using JUCE or some other framework.

* Possibly use MAT's audio-visual framework, allolib. This will be nice for getting the first standalone app done. 

* Being able to feedback the carrier and modulating signals back into themselves would be idea. 

* Maybe allow arbitrary wavetables as well.
